- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JCaspia
- I work in Large Format Printing building Visual Basic applications to automate and streamline design and pre-press operations in the Print Room.
- Currently looking to develop my knowledge of C#.NET and Python through collaboration.
- My aim is to transfer to full-time Software Development in the next two years - help, support or advice is hugely appreciated!
